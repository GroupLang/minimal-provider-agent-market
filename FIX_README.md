# Fix for ra-aid SyntaxError (Fixes #51)

## Issue
The ra-aid package has a syntax error in the `write_file.py` file where an f-string contains square brackets that are not properly escaped, causing a SyntaxError:

```python
# Original problematic code
('initialized empty file' if not complete_file_contents else f'wrote {result['bytes_written']} bytes')
```

## Solution
The fix involves using double quotes for the f-string to avoid conflicts with the single quotes used for dictionary key access:

```python
# Fixed code
('initialized empty file' if not complete_file_contents else f"wrote {result['bytes_written']} bytes")
```

## How to Apply
1. Locate the `write_file.py` file in your ra-aid installation (typically in `/venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/ra_aid/tools/write_file.py`)
2. Apply the patch provided in `fix_write_file.patch`

Or manually edit the file to replace the problematic line with the fixed version.

## Technical Details
The error occurs because Python's f-string parser gets confused when encountering nested single quotes. By using double quotes for the f-string, we allow the single quotes inside to be properly interpreted as dictionary key access.

This is a common issue when mixing f-strings with dictionary access. The solution is to either:
1. Use double quotes for the f-string (as shown in our fix)
2. Or escape the inner quotes
3. Or use alternative dictionary access notation like .get()

Our fix uses option 1 as it's the most readable solution.
